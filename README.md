# Age-vs-Workload-Prediction-Model-using-Polynomial-Regression
This project analyzes the relationship between employees’ age and their average working hours per week using both Linear and Polynomial Regression. The study demonstrates that workforce productivity patterns are nonlinear — with younger employees generally working longer hours, a steady mid-career plateau, and reduced hours near retirement.
